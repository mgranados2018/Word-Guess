# Word-Guess

Purpose of the project: 

    This is coding bootcamp's third homework assignment mainly focused on the use of javascript. We had the option to style the HTML with CSS. The goal of the assignment was to create a hangman game that let the user type in any keyword to guess what the random word was that was selected by the computer. The user was only given 12 chances to attempt to guess the word right. 


Why is this project useful? 

    This project encompassed the use of javascript, HTML and CSS and how they interact with each other. It also enabled me to learn how to code in a standard process. First, to be able to fully understand what the problem is that we are trying to solve through pseudo-code. Second, to set up the structure of the files in Visual Studio Code. Third to write out logic in javascript, add it to HTML and then style it with CSS. Last but not least, to share the project through Github and make the website publicly accessible.
